FIGURE LEGENDS (for manuscript)
================================================================================

Figure 1: Within-Block Entropy Trends by Age Group
Panel A shows mean symbolic entropy (± SEM) across three consecutive trials 
within blocks for older (red) and younger (blue) adults. Older adults exhibit 
a marginally significant increasing trend (mixed-effects β=0.0047, p=0.069), 
while younger adults show no systematic change (β=0.0023, p=0.51). Panel B 
displays the distribution of paired differences (Trial 3 - Trial 1) for each 
group. Panel C shows effect sizes (Cohen's d) with significance indicators 
(† p<0.10). Error bars represent standard error of the mean.

Figure 2: Individual Block Trajectories and Group Comparison
Individual block trajectories (N=50 random blocks per group, thin lines) 
overlaid with group means (thick lines). Each line connects the same block's 
three consecutive trials (T01→T02→T03). Older adults (red) show more upward 
trajectories compared to younger adults (blue), consistent with short-term 
fatigue accumulation.

Figure 3: Between-Day Changes at Subject Level
Spaghetti plot showing each subject's median entropy change from Day 1 to 
Day 2. Each line represents one subject. Older adults (red) predominantly 
show downward slopes (median decrease, p=0.027), while younger adults (blue) 
show no consistent pattern (p=0.18).


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED STATISTICAL REPORTING IN METHODS
================================================================================

"Symbolic entropy was calculated for each trial using k-means clustering 
(k=4) of postural sway features with embedding dimension m=4 and time lag 
τ=50. We analyzed entropy changes across three temporal scales using 
hierarchical approaches:

1) Between-day comparison: Subject-level medians were computed for each day, 
   and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed Day 1 vs Day 2 differences 
   within each age group. Mixed-effects models (random intercept per subject) 
   tested Day × Group interactions.

2) Between-block comparison: One-way repeated measures ANOVA tested entropy 
   differences across the three blocks (B01, B02, B03) within each session.

3) Within-block trial analysis: Mixed-effects linear models examined the 
   relationship between trial position (1, 2, or 3) and entropy, with random 
   intercepts per subject. Paired t-tests compared Trial 1 vs Trial 3 within 
   the same blocks. Bootstrap confidence intervals (5,000 resamples) were 
   computed for mean differences.

Effect sizes were quantified using Cohen's d for paired differences. 
Statistical significance was set at α=0.05, with marginal significance at 
α=0.10. No corrections for multiple comparisons were applied given the 
exploratory nature of these temporal analyses. All analyses were conducted 
in Python 3.9 using statsmodels (v0.14) and scipy (v1.13)."


================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS FOR DISCUSSION SECTION
================================================================================

1. TIME-SCALE SPECIFICITY:
   "Entropy changes exhibited time-scale dependency, with distinct patterns 
   emerging at short (within-block), medium (between-block), and long 
   (between-day) temporal scales."

2. AGE × TIME INTERACTION:
   "A critical finding was the age-specific temporal pattern: older adults 
   showed short-term entropy increases (within-block, p=0.063) but longer-term 
   decreases (between-day, p=0.027), while younger adults maintained stability 
   across all scales."

3. SHORT-TERM FATIGUE IN AGING:
   "The marginally significant within-block entropy increase in older adults 
   (d=0.12) suggests greater susceptibility to immediate task demands, 
   potentially reflecting reduced postural control reserves or slower recovery 
   between consecutive trials."

4. ADAPTATION VS FATIGUE:
   "The between-day entropy decrease in older adults contradicts simple 
   cumulative fatigue and instead suggests motor learning or adaptation, 
   consistent with plasticity preservation in healthy aging."

5. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   "Results suggest that older adults may benefit from micro-breaks during 
   extended balance assessments, as short-term fatigue manifests within 
   ~3 consecutive trials, but that day-to-day performance improves, supporting 
   practice-based interventions."


================================================================================
LIMITATIONS TO ACKNOWLEDGE
================================================================================

1. Effect sizes for within-block changes are small (d ≈ 0.12)
2. Within-block effects are marginally significant (p < 0.10) rather than 
   reaching conventional α = 0.05 threshold
3. Multiple comparisons across time scales increase Type I error risk
4. Sample sizes differ between groups (41 OLD vs 35 YOUNG)
5. Results may not generalize to frail elderly or those with neurological 
   conditions
6. Symbolic entropy is one of many possible complexity metrics
